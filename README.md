# GameBeanAdvance
WIP Gameboy Advance Emulator written in D. Passes 1988/2020 mGBA timing tests, and fourth software-based emulator to pass the AGS Aging Cartridge test. Currently working on improving GBA accuracy.

# Usage
Emulator main project is in `src/emu`.

## Build

### Requirements
+ Dlang + DUB
+ Python3/PyPy3 (packages: `ply`)

### Standard Build

Optionally add `-b release --compiler=ldc2` for optimized build.

```
dub build
```

### Profiling

Build with support for [gperftools_d](https://github.com/prasunanand/gperftools_d). This requires the LDC2 compiler.

```sh
dub build -c gperf --compiler=ldc2 -b release-debug
```

Then, run with the `CPUPROFILE=/tmp/prof.out` environment var to write a profile log.

Finally, convert the log to human readable graph:
```sh
pprof --pdf gamebean-emu /tmp/prof.out > ~/Downloads/gamebean_profile.pdf
```

## Run

Specify path to rom. You can also optionally use `-s` to specify window scaling (default = 1). Note that you must have a __gba_bios.bin__ located in the same directory as the executable. You can acquire a substitute BIOS (see [Cult of GBA](https://github.com/Cult-of-GBA/BIOS)), or you can dump the official BIOS from a GBA.
```
./gamebean-emu [rom]
```

## Tests

To run the tests, run `dub test`. This will test the ARM CPU by running it through the GBA files located in __/tests/asm/bin/__. If the cpu states after every cycle matches the expected states found in the log files in __/tests/asm/log__, then the tests will pass. These roms are written in ARM assembly and are located in __/tests/asm/src__. These tests have their own makefile that produces a .gba file as well as a log file. Logfile production requires having an editted version of NanoBoyAdvance, and having the command `NanoBoyAdvance` added to PATH.
